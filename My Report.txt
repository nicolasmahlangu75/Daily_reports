	I got reasigned to a different project, with a different team. 
	We had our first meeting just outside the office, both Developers and our BA's. 
And we got to share some ideas on the functionalities of our system. Since we didn't have proper documentation, we were forced to just develop the registration and login pages only. I got assigned to do the registration page. 
	I took the opportunity with both hands, since front-end is my strongest point.

4 MARCH 2020


	My former group and i agreed that we are cross nighthing, so i decided to tag along and push my new task. Cross nighting gave us a lot of time to get to understand a lot of things.
